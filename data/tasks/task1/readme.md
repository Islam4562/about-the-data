# Task Description: Dividing Data into Categories for Easy Use

## Objective  
The goal of this task is to take a dataset containing random data and divide it into "shelves" (categories) to make it more convenient for further analysis or research purposes. These shelves can be based on characteristics such as age, product category, and other parameters that can be extracted from the data.

## Task Steps

### 1. Loading the Data  
The input consists of a file with random data containing various attributes such as age, income, product category, and purchase date. The first step is to load this file into the program using the `pandas` library.

### 2. Dividing Data by Age Groups  
One of the requirements is to divide the data by age groups. To achieve this, we create age intervals, for example:
- 0-18 years
- 19-35 years
- 36-50 years
- 51+ years

We use the `pd.cut()` function to categorize the values in the "age" column into these groups. Each value in the "age" column will be assigned the appropriate age group.

### 3. Grouping Data by Product Categories  
The next step is to divide the data based on product categories. The dataset might have a column called "category" that contains values such as "Electronics", "Clothing", "Furniture", "Groceries", etc.

We use the `groupby()` function to group the data by this column. Each group represents a product category.

### 4. Saving Data into Separate Files  
Once the data is divided by age groups and product categories, each of these groups will be saved into a separate CSV file. These files are named to reflect their content, for example:
- `Electronics_data.csv` — for data related to products in the "Electronics" category.
- `age_group_0-18.csv` — for data on users in the 0-18 age group.

These files are saved to disk, making it easier to work with separate groups of data in the future.

## Example of Division

Let’s say we have a dataset with purchase information:

| id  | age | income | category  | purchase_date |
|-----|-----|--------|-----------|---------------|
| 1   | 25  | 50000  | Electronics | 2023-02-15    |
| 2   | 45  | 80000  | Furniture  | 2024-03-01    |
| 3   | 30  | 60000  | Clothing   | 2023-06-21    |
| 4   | 17  | 25000  | Toys       | 2025-01-10    |

After running the task, we would get:

- A file `Electronics_data.csv` containing data for all purchases in the "Electronics" category.
- A file `age_group_0-18.csv` containing data for users in the 0-18 age group.
- A file `age_group_19-35.csv` containing data for users in the 19-35 age group.

## Result  
Each file will contain only the rows of data that belong to the respective category or age group. This division makes it easier to organize the data for further analysis, reporting, or other tasks.

## Advantages
- Simplifies data analysis since each file contains only the relevant categories.
- Makes it easier to process and filter data for further work.
- Convenient when working with large datasets, as dividing them into shelves makes them more manageable.

## Conclusion  
This solution automatically and efficiently divides the data into categories, making it easier to work with and enabling more organized data analysis. It helps reduce complexity and enhances the ability to derive useful insights from large volumes of data.
